=== 1. Description ===
----------------------
'BlueCube' is just another simple (and silly) tetris clone :)


----------------------------------
=== 2. How to compile BlueCube ===
----------------------------------
Just type 'make' to build the binary (called 'bluecube').
Get sure that you have installed gcc and the SDL development packages!

=== 3. Game instructions ===
----------------------------
I think everybody knows good old Tetris and it's not too hard to play.
The 'cluster' (the piece which is falling down) can be controlled
with the arrow keys:

Arrow left ....... Move cluster to the left
Arrow right ...... Move cluster to the right
Arrow down ....... Move cluster down
Arrow up ......... Rotate cluster

The cluster can also be 'dropped', which means that he reaches the
underground immediately and the next cluster will be created.

Space bar ........ Drop cluster

It's quite obvious that the objective of the game is to resolve as
many lines as possible. There are also different levels (as in the original
Tetris), which simply differ from the falling speed of the clusters.
To get to the next level, just make lines, lines and lines... ;)
